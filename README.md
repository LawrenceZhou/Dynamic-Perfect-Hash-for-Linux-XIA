# Dynamic-Perfect-Hash-for-Linux-XIA
This is the implementation of DPH in C.
This the implementation of Dynamic Perfect Hashing in C, referring to the paper of
Martin Dietzfelbinger et. al, Dynamic Perfect Hashing: Upper and Lower Bounds(DPHULB).
Hash is the main hash table, declared as a global variable. Efficiency of this code
changes as parameters in functions as parameters c, SM, etc. change.
